: A crew of five college students marches into the auditorium. Each of the band members is wearing a perfectly tailored suit, and sports neatly combed purple hair.

: The band ascends the stage, as dozens of students from both universities filter into the building.
: The four women in the band are each carrying a glistening violin – and they are led onto the stage by a pale, young man.

[Kristophf, CAPS]: Seriously, you idiots don't know me by this point?! I am [Kristophf] Perrier Delacroix Pellegrino III! Top of my class at Ivytonne Law!
[Kristophf, CAPS]: I am the lead vocalist of the official Ivytonne University band! These are my groupies! And together, we are... [Kristophf] and the [Kristophf]ettes!

[Kristophf, CAPS]: Would you believe that we were once... romantically entangled? [Maria] was my high school sweetheart... my first true love.
[Kristophf, CAPS]: Serene and silent... eyes I could fall into for hours... the hottest sex I've ever had... perfect dimples in her smile... we were truly meant to be together forever.

[Kristophf, CAPS]: ...Or at least, it WOULD be forever, if she hadn't stolen my brand new Lamborghini and crashed it into a fucking ditch!
[Kristophf, CAPS]: Seriously, what the hell?! Who steals shit just to break it?!
[Kristophf, CAPS]: I was willing to let bygones be bygones, and buy myself maybe a Porsche this time... but apparently, SOMEONE drained my entire fucking bank account!
[Kristophf, CAPS]: I had to intern at my father's company for a whole summer just to earn enough to pay my college tuition!
[Kristophf, CAPS]: I was gonna go easy on you, given that you're the worst band in the tournament and all, but this shit's personal now.
